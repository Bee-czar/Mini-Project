  <h3>Basic Profile</h3>
  <p>I was born a long time ago, seems like eons, but maybe no more than a century, same day as riots breaking out in the Belgian Congo, a few months after Fidel angered Ike and a couple of weeks after the opening of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. 
  As far as what I have learned through this journey, let's just say that it has proved that evolution can go backwards. 
  <br><br>With regards to the many projects I have worked on, two of those projects come to mind, that have and continue to enhance business functions for the users. Late 80s early 90s, I worked on a substantial project for managing and providing <a href="https://www.annuityadvantage.com/resources/insurance-company-ratings-explained/" target="_blank">insurance</a> auto risks (CSIO Portal, locality, age, car type, experience, etc) for all insurance providers in Canada inlusive of government owned like ICBC. The second project, and known to many NHL recruiters, facilitating in establishing player value, based on the player's full analytics (speed, endurance, health factuals, etc), all that before <a href="https://www.hockeytech.com/about-us/" target="_blank">Stu Siegel</a> bought the company. Unfortunately, these two companies have no links to the actual projects thus, unable to provide buttons with links.
  Currently, I am highly immersed in a personal horticultural project, <a href="https://www.rbg.ca/" target="_blank">I love plants</a>, financed by yours truly, and written mostly in .Net (Visual Studio 2010 - C# and C++). I will also be taking the full spectrum of courses in the Mobile Application Development program, hopefully finished by August. I do have some basic goto web sites where I harvest knowledge. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">W3schools</a> has always been there when I need clarification on usage of elements, attributes and/or methods. <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11701/Documentation-in-C" target="_blank">CodeProject</a> is also awesome for getting examples of code.
  <br><br>Having been born and lived in a <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/chile/" target="_blank">Latin country</a> as well as the UK and other <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/british-north-america" target="_blank">English colonies</a>, has enriched my language skills, been fluent in Spanish and English. This has enabled me to enjoy a broad spectrum of activities throughout this planet. I've visited most South American countries as well as the greater Caribean islands, where I have indulged  in Scuba, rock climbing, cliff diving and extreme cycling. Again, that life seems so long ago, and now I just get tired when scratching the cat's back &#128514.</p>
